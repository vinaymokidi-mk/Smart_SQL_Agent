## ðŸ’¡ Important Notes

### About Your API Key

The key format `sk-9a76a120efaa4a5d9ab2110308babf0d` suggests this might be:
- A **DeepSeek** API key, OR
- A **Custom/Local LLM** endpoint key, OR  
- An **OpenAI-compatible** API key

If you encounter errors like "Invalid API key":
1. This might not be an OpenAI key
2. You may need to modify the API endpoint
3. The application is configured for OpenAI by default

### If This is a DeepSeek or Other Provider Key

You'll need to update `utils.py` to use the correct API endpoint. Let me know if you need help with this!

### If You Need an OpenAI Key

1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Update `config.py` with your OpenAI key

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files

Your API key is stored in:
- **`config.py`** - Main configuration file (permanent storage)

The application will automatically use this key on every startup!

## âœ… What Works Now

- âœ… API key is permanently configured
- âœ… Application will start without asking for API key
- âœ… File upload works
- âœ… Schema extraction works
- âœ… Natural language to SQL conversion ready
- âœ… Query execution ready
- âœ… Results display ready

## ðŸ§ª Test the Application

### Quick Test:
1. Start the app: `python run_app.py`
2. Open: http://localhost:5000
3. Upload a test Excel/CSV file
4. Ask: "Show me all the data"
5. See the SQL query and results

## ðŸ“‹ Example Workflow

```
1. Upload file â†’ sales_data.xlsx
   âœ… Schema extracted automatically
   
2. Ask: "What are the total sales by region?"
   âœ… SQL generated: SELECT region, SUM(amount) FROM data GROUP BY region
   
3. See results in formatted table
   âœ… North: $50,000
   âœ… South: $45,000
   âœ… East: $38,000
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error?
The key might be for a different provider. Options:
1. Get an OpenAI key from https://platform.openai.com
2. Or let me know which provider this key is for, and I'll update the code

### Port 5000 already in use?
Try a different port:
```python
# Edit web_app.py, line at bottom:
app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)  # Change 5000 to 8080
```

### Missing dependencies?
```bash
pip install -r requirements_robust.txt
```

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready!

Everything is configured. Just run:
```bash
python run_app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 and start querying your data!
