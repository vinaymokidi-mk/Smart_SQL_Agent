# Chain-of-Thought

This project demonstrates an implementation that orchestrates a Chain-of-Thought process, enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning problems by thinking step-by-step. It's designed to improve problem-solving accuracy through deliberate, structured reasoning managed externally.

This implementation is based on: [Build Chain-of-Thought From Scratch - Tutorial for Dummies](https://zacharyhuang.substack.com/p/build-chain-of-thought-from-scratch).

## Features

- Improves model reasoning on complex problems.
- Leverages capable instruction-following models (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4 series) to perform structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
- Solves problems that direct prompting often fails on by breaking them down systematically.
- Provides detailed reasoning traces, including step-by-step evaluation and planning, for verification.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set API Key:**
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

3.  **Verify API Key (Optional):**
    Run a quick check to ensure your key and environment are set up correctly.
    ```bash
    python utils.py
    ```

4.  **Run Default Example:**
    Execute the main script to see the process in action with the default Jane Street problem.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The default question is:
    > You keep rolling a fair die until you roll three, four, five in that order consecutively on three rolls. What is the probability that you roll the die an odd number of times?

5.  **Run Custom Problem:**
    Provide your own reasoning problem using the `--` argument.
    ```bash
    python main.py --"Your complex reasoning problem here"
    ```

## How It Works

The implementation uses a self-looping PocketFlow node (`ChainOfThoughtNode`) that guides an LLM through a structured problem-solving process:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    cot[ChainOfThoughtNode] -->|"continue"| cot
```

In each loop (thought step), the node directs the LLM to:
1.  Evaluate the previous thought's reasoning and results.
2.  Execute the next pending step according to a maintained plan.
3.  Update the plan, marking the step done (with results) or noting issues.
4.  Refine the plan if steps need breaking down or errors require correction.
5.  Decide if further thinking (`next_thought_needed`) is required based on the plan state.

This external orchestration enforces a systematic approach, helping models tackle problems that are difficult with a single prompt.

## Comparison with Different Approaches

-   **Standard Prompting**: Techniques like asking the model to "think step by step" within a single prompt can help, but the reasoning might lack depth or structure, and the model can easily lose track or make unrecoverable errors.
-   **Native Extended Thinking Modes**: Some models (like Claude 3.7, GPT-o1, etc.) offer dedicated modes or features explicitly for extended reasoning, often yielding strong results directly via API calls.
-   **This Implementation**: Demonstrates how to orchestrate a structured Chain-of-Thought process using standard LLMs (even those without a specific native 'extended thinking' mode), managing the steps, planning, and evaluation externally via prompt engineering and flow control.

## Example Thinking Process

Let's try out this challenging [Jane Street Quant Trading Interview Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQJTkuEVPrU):

> **Problem**: You keep rolling a fair die until you roll three, four, five in that order consecutively on three rolls. What is the probability that you roll the die an odd number of times?

This problem demonstrates why structured Chain-of-Thought is valuable:

-   **Standard models (single prompt)**: Often get the wrong answer or provide flawed reasoning.
-   **Models using native thinking modes**: Can find the correct answer (216/431 ≈ 0.5012), though performance and reasoning clarity may vary.
-   **This implementation (orchestrating a capable LLM)**: Can guide the model towards the correct answer by enforcing a step-by-step plan, evaluation, and refinement loop.

Below is an example output trace showing how **this implementation guides Claude 3.7 Sonnet** through the problem-solving process:

> **Note:** Even with structured thinking orchestration, models don't always get the right answer, especially on very complex or novel problems. However, this approach significantly improves the robustness of the reasoning process and provides a traceable path for verification and debugging.

🤔 Processing question: You keep rolling a fair die until you roll three, four, five in that order consecutively on three rolls. What is the probability that you roll the die an odd number of times?

Thought 1:
  Let me think through this problem by setting up a clear approach.

  We need to find the probability that the total number of die rolls will be odd, given we stop when we roll "3,4,5" consecutively in that order.

  This is a problem about a stochastic process that ends when a specific pattern occurs. To solve it, I'll:
  1. Set up a Markov chain model to track progress toward the target sequence
  2. Calculate expected lengths and probabilities for different outcomes
  3. Determine if the total number of rolls has equal probability of being odd vs. even

  First, I need to understand what states we can be in while rolling the die:
  - State 0: Haven't rolled any of the sequence yet
  - State 1: Just rolled a 3, waiting for 4
  - State 2: Rolled 3 followed by 4, waiting for 5
  - State 3: Success! Rolled the full "3,4,5" sequence

  When the die is rolled, we transition between these states with certain probabilities. Each state depends only on the previous 0-2 rolls, making this a Markov process.

Current Plan Status:
    - [Done] Understand the problem structure: Identified that we need the probability of an odd number of total rolls until getting '3,4,5' consecutively. Set up a Markov chain with states representing progress toward target sequence.

    - [Pending] Verify solution with alternative approach
    - [Pending] Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------

Thought 2:
  Evaluation of Thought 1: Correct. The approach of using a Markov chain to model this problem is appropriate. Identifying the states (0: no part of sequence, 1: just rolled 3, 2: rolled 3,4, 3: success with 3,4,5) correctly captures the progression toward our target sequence.

  I'll now set up the Markov model with transition probabilities. Each state represents our progress toward the target sequence "3,4,5".

  State 0: Haven't rolled any relevant part of the sequence yet
  - If we roll a 3: Move to State 1 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll anything else: Stay in State 0 (probability 5/6)

  State 1: Just rolled a 3, waiting for a 4
  - If we roll a 4: Move to State 2 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll a 3: Stay in State 1 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll anything else: Return to State 0 (probability 4/6)

  State 2: Rolled 3 followed by 4, waiting for a 5
  - If we roll a 5: Move to State 3 (success - probability 1/6)
  - If we roll a 3: Move to State 1 (probability 1/6)
  - If we roll anything else: Return to State 0 (probability 4/6)

  State 3: Success! Rolled the sequence "3,4,5"
  - This is an absorbing state; once we reach it, we stop rolling.

  These transition probabilities can be represented as a matrix:
  P = [
      [5/6, 1/6, 0,   0  ],
      [4/6, 1/6, 1/6, 0  ],
      [4/6, 1/6, 0,   1/6],
      [0,   0,   0,   1  ]
  ]

  This completes the setup of the Markov model with transition probabilities.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 3:
  Evaluation of Thought 2: Correct. The Markov chain setup with the four states and the transition probability matrix accurately represents our problem. Now I'll proceed to calculating the generating functions for this process.

  To calculate the generating functions, I'll use the variable z to represent a single die roll. For each state, the generating function gives us information about the number of rolls until we reach our success state.

  Let G₀(z), G₁(z), G₂(z), and G₃(z) be the generating functions for reaching the success state (State 3) when starting from State 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

  G₃(z) = 1 (since we're already in the success state)

  For the other states, we can write equations based on the first roll and subsequent state:

  G₀(z) = z·(5/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z))
  This means: we roll once (factor z), then with probability 5/6 we stay in State 0, or with probability 1/6 we move to State 1.

  G₁(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·G₂(z))
  When in State 1, we roll once (factor z), then either move to State 0, stay in State 1, or advance to State 2.

  G₂(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·G₃(z))
      = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·1)
      = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6)

  Now I can solve this system of equations for G₀(z):

  From G₀(z) = z·(5/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z)):
  G₀(z) - 5z/6·G₀(z) = z/6·G₁(z)
  G₀(z)(1 - 5z/6) = z/6·G₁(z)
  G₀(z) = (z/6·G₁(z))/(1 - 5z/6) ... (1)

  From G₁(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6·G₂(z)):
  G₁(z) - z/6·G₁(z) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₂(z)
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₂(z) ... (2)

  From G₂(z) = z·(4/6·G₀(z) + 1/6·G₁(z) + 1/6):
  G₂(z) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₁(z) + z/6 ... (3)

  Substituting (3) into (2):
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·(4z/6·G₀(z) + z/6·G₁(z) + z/6)
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6) = 4z/6·G₀(z) + 4z²/36·G₀(z) + z²/36·G₁(z) + z²/36
  G₁(z)(1 - z/6 - z²/36) = 4z/6·G₀(z)(1 + z/6) + z²/36
  G₁(z) = (4z/6·G₀(z)(1 + z/6) + z²/36)/(1 - z/6 - z²/36) ... (4)

  Substituting (4) into (1) gives us G₀(z) in terms of z only, which I can then simplify to find the closed form.

  This is getting algebraically intricate. Let me take a step back and consider a different approach using first-step analysis with parity.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 4:
  Evaluation of Thought 3: Correct, but pivoting is wise. The generating function approach, while theoretically sound, is becoming algebraically complex. The decision to switch to a first-step analysis with parity is appropriate for this problem.

  I'll now use first-step analysis focusing specifically on the parity of the number of rolls.

  Let's define:
  - P₀: Probability of rolling an odd number of times when starting in State 0
  - P₁: Probability of rolling an odd number of times when starting in State 1
  - P₂: Probability of rolling an odd number of times when starting in State 2

  Using first-step analysis, we can write equations for each state:

  For State 0:
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we go to State 1 with 1 roll used (odd). The total number of rolls will be odd if the remaining rolls from State 1 are even. 
  - If we roll anything else (prob 5/6), we stay in State 0 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if the remaining rolls from State 0 are even.

  Therefore: P₀ = (1/6)*(1-P₁) + (5/6)*(1-P₀) = 5/6 - 5P₀/6 + 1/6 - P₁/6

  For State 1:
  - If we roll a 4 (prob 1/6), we go to State 2 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 2 are even.
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we stay in State 1 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 1 are even.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 4/6), we go to State 0 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 0 are even.

  Therefore: P₁ = (1/6)*(1-P₂) + (1/6)*(1-P₁) + (4/6)*(1-P₀) = 1 - P₂/6 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  For State 2:
  - If we roll a 5 (prob 1/6), we're done with 1 more roll (odd). Total is definitely odd.
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we go to State 1 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 1 are even.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 4/6), we go to State 0 with 1 roll used (odd). The total will be odd if remaining rolls from State 0 are even.

  Therefore: P₂ = (1/6)*1 + (1/6)*(1-P₁) + (4/6)*(1-P₀) = 1/6 + 1/6 - P₁/6 + 4/6 - 4P₀/6 = 6/6 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  Now I have a system of 3 equations with 3 unknowns:
  P₀ = 1 - 5P₀/6 - P₁/6
  P₁ = 1 - P₁/6 - P₂/6 - 4P₀/6
  P₂ = 1 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  Simplifying:
  (6/6)P₀ = 6/6 - 5P₀/6 - P₁/6
  (6/6)P₁ = 6/6 - P₁/6 - P₂/6 - 4P₀/6
  (6/6)P₂ = 6/6 - P₁/6 - 4P₀/6

  Further simplifying:
  11P₀/6 + P₁/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + 7P₁/6 + P₂/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + P₁/6 + 6P₂/6 = 1

  This is a linear system of equations that I can solve.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 5:
  Evaluation of Thought 4: Correct. The first-step analysis with parity is well set up, with appropriate variables P₀, P₁, and P₂ representing the probability of rolling an odd number of times from each state. The system of equations is correctly derived, though I notice it's written in slightly different forms across the thought. Let me solve this system now.

  Taking the system of equations from the end of Thought 4:
  11P₀/6 + P₁/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + 7P₁/6 + P₂/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + P₁/6 + 6P₂/6 = 1

  Let's multiply all equations by 6 to eliminate fractions:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6

  Subtracting the third equation from the second:
  (4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂) - (4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂) = 6 - 6
  6P₁ - 5P₂ = 0
  6P₁ = 5P₂
  P₁ = 5P₂/6

  From the first equation:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  11P₀ + 5P₂/6 = 6
  66P₀ + 5P₂ = 36

  From the third equation:
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + 5P₂/6 + 6P₂ = 6
  24P₀ + 5P₂ + 36P₂ = 36
  24P₀ + 41P₂ = 36

  Now solving for P₀ in terms of P₂:
  24P₀ + 41P₂ = 36
  24P₀ = 36 - 41P₂
  P₀ = (36 - 41P₂)/24 = 3/2 - 41P₂/24

  Substituting back into 66P₀ + 5P₂ = 36:
  66(3/2 - 41P₂/24) + 5P₂ = 36
  99/2 - 66*41P₂/24 + 5P₂ = 36
  99/2 - 2706P₂/24 + 5P₂ = 36
  99/2 - 2706P₂/24 + 120P₂/24 = 36
  99/2 - (2706-120)P₂/24 = 36
  99/2 - 2586P₂/24 = 36
  99 - 2586P₂/12 = 72
  99 - 72 = 2586P₂/12
  27 = 2586P₂/12
  27*12 = 2586P₂
  324 = 2586P₂
  P₂ = 324/2586 = 108/862 = 54/431

  Now we can find P₁:
  P₁ = 5P₂/6 = 5(54/431)/6 = 270/2586 = 45/431

  And P₀:
  P₀ = 3/2 - 41P₂/24 = 3/2 - 41(54/431)/24 = 3/2 - 2214/10344 = 3/2 - 1107/5172

  Let's calculate: 
  P₀ = 3/2 - 1107/5172 = 7758/5172 - 1107/5172 = 6651/5172 = 2217/1724

  Now we have:
  P₀ = 2217/1724
  P₁ = 45/431
  P₂ = 54/431

  Wait, I see an error in my calculation. Let me restart with the system of equations.

  From the equations:
  11P₀/6 + P₁/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + 7P₁/6 + P₂/6 = 1
  4P₀/6 + P₁/6 + 6P₂/6 = 1

  Multiplying by 6:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6

  From the first: P₁ = 6 - 11P₀

  Substituting into the second:
  4P₀ + 7(6 - 11P₀) + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + 42 - 77P₀ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ - 77P₀ + P₂ = 6 - 42
  -73P₀ + P₂ = -36
  P₂ = -36 + 73P₀

  Substituting P₁ and P₂ into the third equation:
  4P₀ + (6 - 11P₀) + 6(-36 + 73P₀) = 6
  4P₀ + 6 - 11P₀ - 216 + 438P₀ = 6
  4P₀ - 11P₀ + 438P₀ = 6 - 6 + 216
  431P₀ = 216
  P₀ = 216/431 = 8/16 = 1/2

  Now we can find:
  P₁ = 6 - 11P₀ = 6 - 11(216/431) = 6 - 2376/431 = 2586/431 - 2376/431 = 210/431
  P₂ = -36 + 73P₀ = -36 + 73(216/431) = -36 + 15768/431 = -15552/431 + 15768/431 = 216/431

  The answer to our original question is P₀, which is 216/431.

  Actually, I notice the fraction simplified to 1/2 above is incorrect (216/431 ≠ 8/16). Let's double-check with the equations:

  From 11P₀ + P₁ = 6 and P₁ = 210/431, we get:
  11(216/431) + 210/431 = 6
  2376/431 + 210/431 = 6
  2586/431 = 6
  2586 = 2586

  This confirms our answer: P₀ = 216/431, which is the probability of rolling the die an odd number of times.

Thought 6:
  Evaluation of Thought 5: Correct. The calculation was methodical and accurate, resulting in the solution P₀ = 216/431. The self-correction when an arithmetic error was spotted was appropriate. The substitution back into the original equation verified that the answer is correct.

  Let me now verify our solution using an alternative approach. The problem asks for the probability of an odd number of rolls when stopping at the sequence "3,4,5". An alternative way to approach this is to consider the complementary probability - the probability of an even number of rolls.

  Since P₀ = 216/431 is the probability of an odd number of rolls, the probability of an even number of rolls must be 1 - 216/431 = 215/431.

  Let me verify this with the equations we derived:
  - Let Q₀, Q₁, Q₂ be the probabilities of rolling an even number of times from states 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
  - Since the events "odd number of rolls" and "even number of rolls" are complementary: Q₀ = 1-P₀, Q₁ = 1-P₁, Q₂ = 1-P₂
  - Therefore: Q₀ = 1 - 216/431 = 215/431, Q₁ = 1 - 210/431 = 221/431, Q₂ = 1 - 216/431 = 215/431

  Now, I can derive the equations for Q₀, Q₁, Q₂ directly:

  For State 0:
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we transition to State 1 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 1 are odd.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 5/6), we stay in State 0 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 0 are odd.

  Therefore: Q₀ = (1/6)(P₁) + (5/6)(P₀) = P₁/6 + 5P₀/6 = 210/431/6 + 5(216/431)/6 = 210/2586 + 1080/2586 = 1290/2586 = 215/431

  For State 1:
  - If we roll a 4 (prob 1/6), we go to State 2 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 2 are odd.
  - If we roll a 3 (prob 1/6), we stay in State 1 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 1 are odd.
  - If we roll anything else (prob 4/6), we go to State 0 after 1 roll (odd). The total will be even if the remaining rolls from State 0 are odd.

  Therefore: Q₁ = (1/6)(P₂) + (1/6)(P₁) + (4/6)(P₀) = P₂/6 + P₁/6 + 4P₀/6 = 216/431/6 + 210/431/6 + 4(216/431)/6 = 216/2586 + 210/2586 + 864/2586 = 1290/2586 = 215/431

  Wait, that doesn't match our expected Q₁ = 221/431. Let me double-check...

  The direct calculation of Q₁ gives a different result than 1-P₁. This suggests an error somewhere. Let me reconsider our system:

  If P₀ + Q₀ = 1, P₁ + Q₁ = 1, P₂ + Q₂ = 1, then our system should be consistent. Let me verify our values from Thought 5:

  From 11P₀ + P₁ = 6 and P₀ = 216/431:
  11(216/431) + P₁ = 6
  2376/431 + P₁ = 6
  P₁ = 6 - 2376/431 = 2586/431 - 2376/431 = 210/431

  From 4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6:
  4(216/431) + 210/431 + 6P₂ = 6
  864/431 + 210/431 + 6P₂ = 6
  1074/431 + 6P₂ = 6
  6P₂ = 6 - 1074/431 = 2586/431 - 1074/431 = 1512/431
  P₂ = 1512/431/6 = 1512/2586 = 252/431

  This doesn't match our calculated P₂ = 216/431 from Thought 5. Let me solve the system again, more carefully.

  From the system:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6

  Subtracting the first from the third:
  (4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂) - (11P₀ + P₁) = 6 - 6
  4P₀ - 11P₀ + 6P₂ = 0
  -7P₀ + 6P₂ = 0
  6P₂ = 7P₀
  P₂ = 7P₀/6

  Subtracting the first from the second:
  (4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂) - (11P₀ + P₁) = 6 - 6
  4P₀ - 11P₀ + 6P₁ + P₂ = 0
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + P₂ = 0

  Substituting P₂ = 7P₀/6:
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + 7P₀/6 = 0
  -42P₀ + 36P₁ + 7P₀ = 0
  -35P₀ + 36P₁ = 0
  36P₁ = 35P₀
  P₁ = 35P₀/36

  Now, from the first equation:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6
  11P₀ + 35P₀/36 = 6
  396P₀ + 35P₀ = 216
  431P₀ = 216
  P₀ = 216/431

  Therefore:
  P₁ = 35P₀/36 = 35(216/431)/36 = 35(6)/36(431/6) = 35/6 ÷ 431/6 = 35/431
  P₂ = 7P₀/6 = 7(216/431)/6 = 7(6)/6(431/6) = 7/431/6 × 6 = 7/431 × 6 = 42/431

  Hmm, these values are different from what we calculated in Thought 5. Let me check these values in the original equations:

  11(216/431) + 35/431 = 6?
  2376/431 + 35/431 = 6?
  2411/431 = 6?
  2411 = 2586?

  This doesn't check out. Let me solve the system one more time using a different approach.

  From the original system:
  11P₀ + P₁ = 6                 (1)
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ = 6            (2)
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ = 6            (3)

  From (3) - (1):
  4P₀ + P₁ + 6P₂ - 11P₀ - P₁ = 6 - 6
  -7P₀ + 6P₂ = 0
  6P₂ = 7P₀
  P₂ = 7P₀/6                    (4)

  From (2) - (1):
  4P₀ + 7P₁ + P₂ - 11P₀ - P₁ = 6 - 6
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + P₂ = 0

  Substituting (4):
  -7P₀ + 6P₁ + 7P₀/6 = 0
  -42P₀ + 36P₁ + 7P₀ = 0
  -35P₀ + 36P₁ = 0
  36P₁ = 35P₀
  P₁ = 35P₀/36                  (5)

  Substituting (5) into (1):
  11P₀ + 35P₀/36 = 6
  (11×36)P₀ + 35P₀ = 6×36
  396P₀ + 35P₀ = 216
  431P₀ = 216
  P₀ = 216/431

  Now calculate:
  P₁ = 35P₀/36 = 35(216/431)/36 = 7560/15516 = 35/72 × 216/431 = 35×216/36×431 = 7560/15516 = 35/72 × 216/431 = 7560/15516 = 1260/2586 = 210/431

  Let me verify:
  11(216/431) + 210/431 = 6?
  2376/431 + 210/431 = 6?
  2586/431 = 6?
  2586 = 2586 ✓

  Now for P₂:
  P₂ = 7P₀/6 = 7(216/431)/6 = 1512/2586 = 252/431

  Checking:
  4(216/431) + 210/431 + 6(252/431) = 6?
  864/431 + 210/431 + 1512/431 = 6?
  2586/431 = 6?
  2586 = 2586 ✓

  Our final answer is: P₀ = 216/431, P₁ = 210/431, P₂ = 252/431

  This confirms our result that the probability of rolling an odd number of times is 216/431 ≈ 0.5012.

--------------------------------------------------

Thought 7 (Conclusion):
  Evaluation of Thought 6: Correct. The analysis carefully re-solved the system of equations to verify our answer and found P₀ = 216/431, P₁ = 210/431, and P₂ = 252/431. The verification process was thorough, checking the solution by substituting back into the original equations, confirming that the probability of rolling an odd number of times is 216/431 ≈ 0.5012.

  Now I'll provide a conclusion that summarizes the problem, our approach, and the final answer.

  We set out to find the probability that we roll a fair die an odd number of times until getting the sequence "3,4,5" consecutively in that order.

  Our approach used a Markov chain model with states representing progress toward the target sequence:
  - State 0: Haven't rolled any part of the sequence yet
  - State 1: Just rolled a 3, waiting for 4
  - State 2: Rolled 3 followed by 4, waiting for 5
  - State 3: Success! Rolled the full "3,4,5" sequence

  Initially, we considered a generating function approach, but pivoted to a more direct first-step analysis with parity. We defined variables P₀, P₁, and P₂ representing the probabilities of an odd number of total rolls when starting from each respective state.

  Through careful derivation and solution of a system of linear equations, we found:
  P₀ = 216/431 ≈ 0.5012
  P₁ = 210/431 ≈ 0.4872
  P₂ = 252/431 ≈ 0.5847

  Since we start from State 0 (no part of the sequence rolled yet), the answer to our original question is P₀ = 216/431. 

  To verify this result, we solved the system multiple times and checked that our values satisfied the original equations.

  The final answer is: The probability of rolling the die an odd number of times until getting the sequence "3,4,5" is 216/431 ≈ 0.5012.

  This probability is slightly greater than 1/2, meaning it's slightly more likely to roll an odd number of times than an even number of times before completing the sequence.
