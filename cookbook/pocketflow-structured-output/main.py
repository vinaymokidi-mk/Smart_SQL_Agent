Analyze the resume below. Output ONLY the requested information in YAML format.

**Resume:**
```
{resume_text}
```

**Target Skills (use these indexes):**
```
{skill_list_for_prompt}
```

**YAML Output Requirements:**
- Extract `name` (string).
- Extract `email` (string).
- Extract `experience` (list of objects with `title` and `company`).
- Extract `skill_indexes` (list of integers found from the Target Skills list).
- **Add a YAML comment (`#`) explaining the source BEFORE `name`, `email`, `experience`, each item in `experience`, and `skill_indexes`.**

**Example Format:**
```yaml
# Found name at top
name: Jane Doe
# Found email in contact info
email: jane@example.com
# Experience section analysis
experience:
  # First job listed
  - title: Manager
    company: Corp A
  # Second job listed
  - title: Assistant
    company: Corp B
# Skills identified from the target list based on resume content
skill_indexes:
  # Found 0 at top  
  - 0
  # Found 2 in experience
  - 2
```
