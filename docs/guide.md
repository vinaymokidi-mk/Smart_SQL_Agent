# Agentic Coding: Humans Design, Agents code!

> If you are an AI agent involved in building LLM Systems, read this guide **VERY, VERY** carefully! This is the most important chapter in the entire document. Throughout development, you should always (1) start with a small and simple solution, (2) design at a high level (`docs/design.md`) before implementation, and (3) frequently ask humans for feedback and clarification.

## Agentic Coding Steps

Agentic Coding should be a collaboration between Human System Design and Agent Implementation:

| Steps                  | Human      | AI        | Comment                                                                 |
|:-----------------------|:----------:|:---------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Requirements | â˜…â˜…â˜… High  | â˜…â˜†â˜† Low   | Humans understand the requirements and context.                    |
| 2. Flow          | â˜…â˜…â˜† Medium | â˜…â˜…â˜† Medium |  Humans specify the high-level design, and the AI fills in the details. |

1. **Requirements**: Clarify the requirements for your project, and evaluate whether an AI system is a good fit. 
    - Understand AI systems' strengths and limitations:
      - **Good for**: Routine tasks requiring common sense (filling forms, replying to emails)
      - **Good for**: Creative tasks with well-defined inputs (building slides, writing SQL)
      - **Not good for**: Ambiguous problems requiring complex decision-making (business strategy, startup planning)
    - **Keep It User-Centric:** Explain the "problem" from the user's perspective rather than just listing features.
    - **Balance complexity vs. impact**: Aim to deliver the highest value features with minimal complexity early.

2. **Flow Design**: Outline at a high level, describe how your AI system orchestrates nodes.
    - Identify applicable design patterns (e.g., [Map Reduce](./design_pattern/mapreduce.md), [Agent](./design_pattern/agent.md), [RAG](./design_pattern/rag.md)).
      - For each node in the flow, start with a high-level one-line description of what it does.
      - If using **Map Reduce**, specify how to map (what to split) and how to reduce (how to combine).
      - If using **Agent**, specify what are the inputs (context) and what are the possible actions.
      - If using **RAG**, specify what to embed, noting that there's usually both offline (indexing) and online (retrieval) workflows.
    - Outline the flow and draw it in a mermaid diagram. For example:
      ```mermaid
      flowchart LR
          start[Start] --> batch[Batch]
          batch --> check[Check]
          check -->|OK| process
          check -->|Error| fix[Fix]
          fix --> check
          
          subgraph process[Process]
            step1[Step 1] --> step2[Step 2]
          end
          
          process --> endNode[End]
      ```
    - > **If Humans can't specify the flow, AI Agents can't automate it!** Before building an LLM system, thoroughly understand the problem and potential solution by manually solving example inputs to develop intuition.  
      {: .best-practice }

3. **Utilities**: Based on the Flow Design, identify and implement necessary utility functions.
    - Think of your AI system as the brain. It needs a bodyâ€”these *external utility functions*â€”to interact with the real world:
        <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/.github/raw/main/assets/utility.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>

        - Reading inputs (e.g., retrieving Slack messages, reading emails)
        - Writing outputs (e.g., generating reports, sending emails)
        - Using external tools (e.g., calling LLMs, searching the web)
        - **NOTE**: *LLM-based tasks* (e.g., summarizing text, analyzing sentiment) are **NOT** utility functions; rather, they are *core functions* internal in the AI system.
    - For each utility function, implement it and write a simple test.
    - Document their input/output, as well as why they are necessary. For example:
      - `name`: `get_embedding` (`utils/get_embedding.py`)
      - `input`: `str`
      - `output`: a vector of 3072 floats
      - `necessity`: Used by the second node to embed text
    - Example utility implementation:
      ```python
      # utils/call_llm.py
      from openai import OpenAI

      def call_llm(prompt):    
          client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
          r = client.chat.completions.create(
              model="gpt-4o",
              messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
          )
          return r.choices[0].message.content
          
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          prompt = "What is the meaning of life?"
          print(call_llm(prompt))
      ```
    - > **Sometimes, design Utilities before Flow:**  For example, for an LLM project to automate a legacy system, the bottleneck will likely be the available interface to that system. Start by designing the hardest utilities for interfacing, and then build the flow around them.
      {: .best-practice }
    - > **Avoid Exception Handling in Utilities**: If a utility function is called from a Node's `exec()` method, avoid using `try...except` blocks within the utility. Let the Node's built-in retry mechanism handle failures.
      {: .warning }

4. **Data Design**: Design the shared store that nodes will use to communicate.
   - One core design principle for PocketFlow is to use a well-designed [shared store](./core_abstraction/communication.md)â€”a data contract that all nodes agree upon to retrieve and store data.
      - For simple systems, use an in-memory dictionary.
      - For more complex systems or when persistence is required, use a database.
      - **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Use in-memory references or foreign keys.
      - Example shared store design:
        ```python
        shared = {
            "user": {
                "id": "user123",
                "context": {                # Another nested dict
                    "weather": {"temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"},
                    "location": "San Francisco"
                }
            },
            "results": {}                   # Empty dict to store outputs
        }
        ```

5. **Node Design**: Plan how each node will read and write data, and use utility functions.
   - For each [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md), describe its type, how it reads and writes data, and which utility function it uses. Keep it specific but high-level without codes. For example:
     - `type`: Regular (or Batch, or Async)
     - `prep`: Read "text" from the shared store
     - `exec`: Call the embedding utility function. **Avoid exception handling here**; let the Node's retry mechanism manage failures.
     - `post`: Write "embedding" to the shared store

6. **Implementation**: Implement the initial nodes and flows based on the design.
   - ðŸŽ‰ If you've reached this step, humans have finished the design. Now *Agentic Coding* begins!
   - **"Keep it simple, stupid!"** Avoid complex features and full-scale type checking.
   - **FAIL FAST**! Leverage the built-in [Node](./core_abstraction/node.md) retry and fallback mechanisms to handle failures gracefully. This helps you quickly identify weak points in the system.
   - Add logging throughout the code to facilitate debugging.

7. **Optimization**:
   - **Use Intuition**: For a quick initial evaluation, human intuition is often a good start.
   - **Redesign Flow (Back to Step 3)**: Consider breaking down tasks further, introducing agentic decisions, or better managing input contexts.
   - If your flow design is already solid, move on to micro-optimizations:
     - **Prompt Engineering**: Use clear, specific instructions with examples to reduce ambiguity.
     - **In-Context Learning**: Provide robust examples for tasks that are difficult to specify with instructions alone.

   - > **You'll likely iterate a lot!** Expect to repeat Steps 3â€“6 hundreds of times.
     >
     > <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/the-pocket/.github/raw/main/assets/success.png?raw=true" width="400"/></div>
     {: .best-practice }

8. **Reliability**  
   - **Node Retries**: Add checks in the node `exec` to ensure outputs meet requirements, and consider increasing `max_retries` and `wait` times.
   - **Logging and Visualization**: Maintain logs of all attempts and visualize node results for easier debugging.
   - **Self-Evaluation**: Add a separate node (powered by an LLM) to review outputs when results are uncertain.

## Example LLM Project File Structure

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ nodes.py
â”œâ”€â”€ flow.py
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ call_llm.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search_web.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ design.md
```

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
  ```
  PyYAML
  pocketflow
  ```

- **`docs/design.md`**: Contains project documentation for each step above. This should be *high-level* and *no-code*.

  # Design Doc: Your Project Name

  > Please DON'T remove notes for AI

  ## Requirements

  > Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
  > If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories


  ## Flow Design

  > Notes for AI:
  > 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
  > 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

  ### Applicable Design Pattern:

  1. Map the file summary into chunks, then reduce these chunks into a final summary.
  2. Agentic file finder
    - *Context*: The entire summary of the file
    - *Action*: Find the file

  ### Flow high-level Design:

  1. **First Node**: This node is for ...
  2. **Second Node**: This node is for ...
  3. **Third Node**: This node is for ...

  ```mermaid
  flowchart TD
      firstNode[First Node] --> secondNode[Second Node]
      secondNode --> thirdNode[Third Node]
  ```
  ## Utility Functions

  > Notes for AI:
  > 1. Understand the utility function definition thoroughly by reviewing the doc.
  > 2. Include only the necessary utility functions, based on nodes in the flow.

  1. **Call LLM** (`utils/call_llm.py`)
    - *Input*: prompt (str)
    - *Output*: response (str)
    - Generally used by most nodes for LLM tasks

  2. **Embedding** (`utils/get_embedding.py`)
    - *Input*: str
    - *Output*: a vector of 3072 floats
    - Used by the second node to embed text

  ## Node Design

  ### Shared Store

  > Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

  The shared store structure is organized as follows:

  ```python
  shared = {
      "key": "value"
  }
  ```

  ### Node Steps

  > Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

  1. First Node
    - *Purpose*: Provide a short explanation of the nodeâ€™s function
    - *Type*: Decide between Regular, Batch, or Async
    - *Steps*:
      - *prep*: Read "key" from the shared store
      - *exec*: Call the utility function
      - *post*: Write "key" to the shared store

  2. Second Node
    ...
  ~~~


- **`utils/`**: Contains all utility functions.
  - It's recommended to dedicate one Python file to each API call, for example `call_llm.py` or `search_web.py`.
  - Each file should also include a `main()` function to try that API call
  ```python
  from google import genai
  import os

  def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
      client = genai.Client(
          api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY", ""),
      )
      model = os.getenv("GEMINI_MODEL", "gemini-2.5-flash")
      response = client.models.generate_content(model=model, contents=[prompt])
      return response.text

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      test_prompt = "Hello, how are you?"

      # First call - should hit the API
      print("Making call...")
      response1 = call_llm(test_prompt, use_cache=False)
      print(f"Response: {response1}")
  ```

- **`nodes.py`**: Contains all the node definitions.
  ```python
  # nodes.py
  from pocketflow import Node
  from utils.call_llm import call_llm

  class GetQuestionNode(Node):
      def exec(self, _):
          # Get question directly from user input
          user_question = input("Enter your question: ")
          return user_question
      
      def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
          # Store the user's question
          shared["question"] = exec_res
          return "default"  # Go to the next node

  class AnswerNode(Node):
      def prep(self, shared):
          # Read question from shared
          return shared["question"]
      
      def exec(self, question):
          # Call LLM to get the answer
          return call_llm(question)
      
      def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
          # Store the answer in shared
          shared["answer"] = exec_res
  ```
- **`flow.py`**: Implements functions that create flows by importing node definitions and connecting them.
  ```python
  # flow.py
  from pocketflow import Flow
  from nodes import GetQuestionNode, AnswerNode

  def create_qa_flow():
      """Create and return a question-answering flow."""
      # Create nodes
      get_question_node = GetQuestionNode()
      answer_node = AnswerNode()
      
      # Connect nodes in sequence
      get_question_node >> answer_node
      
      # Create flow starting with input node
      return Flow(start=get_question_node)
  ```
- **`main.py`**: Serves as the project's entry point.
  ```python
  # main.py
  from flow import create_qa_flow

  # Example main function
  # Please replace this with your own main function
  def main():
      shared = {
          "question": None,  # Will be populated by GetQuestionNode from user input
          "answer": None     # Will be populated by AnswerNode
      }

      # Create the flow and run it
      qa_flow = create_qa_flow()
      qa_flow.run(shared)
      print(f"Question: {shared['question']}")
      print(f"Answer: {shared['answer']}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
